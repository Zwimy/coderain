"""Boot the real SPA in a real browser and click through it (2026-07-28).

webapp_test.py proves the modules fit together; only a browser proves they RUN.
A name that was module-scoped before the ES-module split, a handler bound to an
element that no longer exists, a view that throws on first paint — all of those
are green in a static check and broken on screen.

OPTIONAL BY DESIGN. Coderain's runtime dependencies are deliberately light, and
a browser driver is not one of them. Without playwright this suite prints how to
enable it and exits 0, so `python run_tests.py` stays green on a clean checkout:

    .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install playwright
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m playwright install chromium

Asserts, once it can run:
 1) every view renders, with a clean console and no 5xx;
 2) the modals that cross module boundaries open and carry real content;
 3) navigation cleans up after itself (the Talk drawer does not orphan);
 4) a slow view cannot paint over a newer navigation.
